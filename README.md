Chrome Extension Ideas:

    Simple, current, example
    Example where 'bb' precursor isn't necessary (automatically intercepts and converts requests)
    Ability to index bookmarked docs using Azure Search, then allow you to search across only your bookmarks.
    Easily add bookmark using shortcut key or by opening browser toolbar button (detects current tab link and allows u to just enter a key)
    Maybe handle bookmark groups too?
