# better-bookmarks

Next steps
    
- Enable bookmark tagging (adding tags when saving a bookmark)
- Make the management experience better (not part of extension options most likely)
- Enable bookmark 'groups' - all tabs in current window under one bookmark group name
- Make/acquire a prettier logo (cheaply)
- Add 'help' experience (first bookmark == bb help....loads extension content with simple, general, help)
- Make the extension icon differ when the user is not signed in (like lastpass)
- Add app icon to better-bookmark search result options 
    (or, better yet maybe, fetch the icon from the link's website itself - it's favico.ico)

Chrome Extension Ideas:

    Simple, current, example
    Example where 'bb' precursor isn't necessary (automatically intercepts and converts requests)
    Ability to index bookmarked docs using Azure Search, then allow you to search across only your bookmarks.
    Easily add bookmark using shortcut key or by opening browser toolbar button (detects current tab link and allows u to just enter a key)
